# Photo Frame Grid

This is a simple web project that displays a grid of flower photos in a styled photo frame layout. It includes a title, a grid of images, and a footer with the author's name.

## Features

- Responsive grid layout to showcase flower images.
- Each image is wrapped inside a box with consistent styling.
- A highlighted "middle-box" with a custom class for special styling.
- Simple semantic HTML structure with headings and image alt attributes.

## Project Structure

/project-folder
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── styles.css # CSS file for styling (linked in HTML)
└── flower-images/ # Folder containing all flower images
├── image.1.avif
├── img2.jpg
├── img3.jpg
├── ... # other images
## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder to your local machine.
2. Make sure the `flower-images` folder is present with all the image files.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
4. You should see a grid of flower images displayed with a title on top and author name below.

## Notes

- Images are loaded locally from the `flower-images` directory.
- To customize, replace or add images inside the `flower-images` folder and update the HTML accordingly.
- The project uses an external `styles.css` file for styling, so ensure it's present in the same folder as `index.html`.
